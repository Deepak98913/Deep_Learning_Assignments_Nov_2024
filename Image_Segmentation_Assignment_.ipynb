        "Ans :- ### **Definition of Image Segmentation**\n",
        "Image segmentation is a computer vision technique that involves partitioning an image into multiple segments or regions to simplify its representation and make it more meaningful and easier to analyze. The goal is to group pixels into regions based on certain criteria such as color, texture, or intensity, and assign labels to each region. This allows for the isolation of specific objects or areas of interest within an image.\n",
